## basic-fullstack-app

This project was undertaken after getting inspired by a Youtube tutorial I saw from Coding Train, for a twitter messageing clone. 

I thought I could take this idea and put the elements into a table, this is something I want to take further to create a functional 
application for storing products and giving a sell for value, [link to that project](https://github.com/shuabrannigan/product-list-db-app)
